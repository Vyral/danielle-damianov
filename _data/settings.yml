  about_markdown: |
    I have 17 Years in the Mortgage and Real Estate Industry. I have spent 10 years in Mortgage Lending as a Mortgage Broker, Mortgage Processor and owner of a Mortgage Company/ Correspondent Lender. In 2009, I decided to go into Real Estate Full time and sold Residential Real Estate in Southwest Florida (Fort Myers/ Naples) and South Florida (Miami/ Ft. Lauderdale) for the past 7 years. Although I have had many successes in the Real Estate business, my passion has always been helping clients with their financing needs. I am dedicated to finding my clients the best loan programs and rates and offer a variety of loans to include Purchase, Jumbo Loans, Construction to Perm, Refinance, VA Loans, FHA Loans, and Renovation Loans. My 17 Years experience in both Real Estate and Mortgage will allow me to help my clients with their financing needs throughout Florida while offering the same commitment, dedication and the Top Notch customer service.
