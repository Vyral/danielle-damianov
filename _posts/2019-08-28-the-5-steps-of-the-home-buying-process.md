There are five main steps to the home buying process that you need to prepare yourself for if you’re thinking of buying a home soon:

**1\. The mortgage application/pre-approval process.** You need to apply for your mortgage loan before you start looking at properties because you need to know what you qualify for, what your monthly payment will be, and what terms your mortgage will include.&nbsp;

**2\. Home shopping.** This is the fun part—you and your Realtor get to start searching for the home that’s just right for you. Once you find it, it’s time for the next step.

**3\. Executing the contract.** You and your Realtor will make an offer, and if it’s accepted, negotiate with the seller and their listing agent and have an executed contract.&nbsp;

**4\. Your loan gets sent to underwriting.** Here, the underwriter will review your loan and issue a conditional loan approval. This doesn’t mean you’re clear to close, though. Oftentimes, underwriters will find items in the loan that they’ll request additional documentation for. Once you’ve submitted this documentation and have your conditional loan approval, it’s time for the last step.&nbsp;

**5\. You’re clear to close.** Once you’re clear to close, your loan will move to the closing department and they’ll work with the title company to arrange a time for you to officially close on your new home.&nbsp;
