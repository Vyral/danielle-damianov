{% include youtube.html %}One of the questions I get all the time is, “What are rates doing today?” It’s really difficult for anyone to tell you what the actual rate would be for a loan because there are so many different things that go into this number. Lenders factor in credit score, program type, type of property, whether it’s an investment or primary residence, location, and many other factors when determining a buyer's rate. If you are thinking about getting pre-qualified for a mortgage and want to know what your interest rate would be, I’d be glad to help you if you reach out today.
