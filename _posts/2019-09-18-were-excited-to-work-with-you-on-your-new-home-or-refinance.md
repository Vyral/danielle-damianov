{% include youtube.html %}Thank you so much for your application\! My team and I are excited to work with you on your new home or refinance. If you haven’t uploaded your documents yet, I encourage you to do so as soon as possible. That way, we know what you qualify for. Also keep in mind that your credit report is good for four months, meaning we won’t have to pull your credit again as long as you’ve closed within the last four months. All of your income and asset documents have to updated within 30 days of closing, so we may have to request more items from you once your file goes to processing. Additionally, make sure you understand how interest rates work—they change daily, so until we have a contract on your home, we won’t be able to lock in your interest rate. To find out more information, watch this short video.
