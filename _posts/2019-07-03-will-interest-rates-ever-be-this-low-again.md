{% include youtube.html %}In case you weren’t aware already, I am here to tell you that interest rates are incredibly low right now. If you are thinking about buying a new home or refinancing your current one, now is a fantastic time to do so. If you have high-interest credit card debt, we may be able to pay that off while also lowering your monthly mortgage payment. I don’t know when we’ll see rates this low again, so take advantage of them while you can. To learn more, watch my latest video.
