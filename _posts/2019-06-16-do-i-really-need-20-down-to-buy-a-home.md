  In the past, most people put a standard 20% down on a home. With all of the
  programs available to us today, however, the large down payments are no longer
  necessary.

I hear from potential homebuyers all the time, and the biggest question I hear is, “Do I really need 20% down to get a mortgage?”&nbsp;

**The answer is no.** We have so many different programs out there, whether you’re a first-time buyer or not, that don’t require 20% for a down payment. In fact, we just rolled out a 101% financing program. It’s a 97% first mortgage with a 4% second. **With this product, you can basically get into a home with nothing out of pocket.** That’s a lot cheaper than paying your first month, last month, and security deposit if you were renting.

Another thing we offer is a program with a 10% to 15% down payment for 2nd-home or investment buyers.

**No matter what your home buying goals are, you certainly don’t need 20% to make a purchase.** If you have any questions for me about specific loan programs or about mortgages in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
