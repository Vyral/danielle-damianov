Studies show that staged listings generally outperform non-staged listings, and when you look at the before and after photos in today’s video, it’s no wonder why. Staging brings out a space’s full potential, shows buyers what kind of lifestyle they could create there, and draws out the kind of emotional response that no vacant room likely could.&nbsp;

To better explain the power of staging, I recently sat down with a professional stager (and a long-time friend of mine) Adriana Torres of Stage and Amaze to discuss her thoughts on the subject.

Stage and Amaze has been in business for almost eight years, during which time Adriana and her team has helped countless agents, builders, investors, and sellers to make the most of the space they’re working with. **You can see Adriana’s work in action by checking out the before-and-after slideshow we’ve included starting at 1:38 in the video above.** Each of the listings included in this slideshow sold quickly and for top dollar thanks to the efforts of Adriana and her team.

If you’d like to learn more about Stage and Amaze, feel free to visit their [website](http://www.stageandamaze.com)or give Adriana a call at (239) 738-0951.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other questions for me or would like to discuss your real estate needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
