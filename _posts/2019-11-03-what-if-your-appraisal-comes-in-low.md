Whether you’re buying or refinancing a home, there are a couple of things you can do if your appraisal comes in low.

First, **you can see if there are any more comparable properties that have recently sold that the appraiser didn’t use.** If there are, you can show the appraiser those comparable properties and ask that they be added to the appraisal. I’ve done this for my clients several times in the past, and in each instance, the home’s value increased to where we needed it to be.

Second, **you can see if the appraiser made any mistakes with their appraisal.** In this case, we’d have our appraisal reviewer check the appraisal for any major mistakes. If any major mistakes are found you can ask for a second appraisal.&nbsp;

Additionally, we have a great tool here at Guaranteed Rate that may allow you to secure an appraisal waiver for conforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans. We’re starting to see quite a few refinances and home purchases that don’t even require an appraisal. If you’re a homeowner looking to refinance or you’re an agent wondering whether one of your properties will receive an appraisal waiver, send me an email and I’d be happy to assist you.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this or any other mortgage-related topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
