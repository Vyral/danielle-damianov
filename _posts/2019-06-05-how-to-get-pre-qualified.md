If you’re thinking about getting pre-qualified for a mortgage, or if you’re just curious what you’d qualify for, here’s how to go about it:

First, fill out the loan application. Once I have your loan application, we’ll look at four main criteria: credit, income, assets, and your debt ratio. All four of these criteria will factor into what program is best for you, what the down payment requirements would be, what your interest rate would be, and what your monthly mortgage payment would look like.

If you’d like to apply online, you can do so on my website **[www.LendFLA.com](https://www.rate.com/loan-expert/danielledamianov){: target="_blank"}**. For other questions you have, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
