There are so many self-employed borrowers out there that aren’t able to buy a home because of the advantages that they take from being self-employed.&nbsp;

**Unfortunately, if you’re trying to buy with a conforming or conventional loan, we do have to take an average of the last two years of your tax returns.** If you’ve been self-employed for more than five years, we may be able to get away with just a one-year tax return product.

If this is something you're struggling with, I have a program for you. **We can get you hooked up with a business or personal bank statement program where you will put 10% down on the home all the way up to $3 million.**&nbsp;

This loan has no monthly mortgage insurance and can be used for an owner-occupied home, a second home, or an investment property purchase. If you have a short sale or foreclosure just a few years ago, this program can help you, too. **It’s a great program with a lot of flexibility.**&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me about this loan or anything else related to financing your next home purchase, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
