You’re right in the thick of your house-hunting journey, but you’re not sure if you should **purchase the home you find in cash or through a mortgage.** After all, you have the money to buy a home outright, so which option is best?

Before you decide, there are a few things you ought to think about:&nbsp;

If you only have enough cash for the home purchase itself, you may still want to get a mortgage. First, this ensures that **you’ll maintain liquidity,** not to mention that it’s almost never a good idea to put all your cash toward a house because you may need to spend some of it if you’re in a tight spot down the road.

It’s worth noting that **interest rates are incredibly low right now.** Instead of completely using up your cash, why not take advantage of this window of opportunity to secure a mortgage with an exceptionally low payment?

A third consideration is **your return on investment.** Holding onto your cash and investing it elsewhere may prove to be much more rewarding in the long-term. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

There are also **tax incentives.** Homeowners who have a mortgage enjoy tax breaks that you wouldn’t receive if you paid for your home up front.
